# Intro to WAR Files

**Definition:** WAR (.war) files are web app archives. A .war is a special kind of JAR that can distribute XML files, tag libraries, static webpages,
Java classes, Java Servlets, and JavaServer pages. These resources, when integrated and implemented together, are considered a web application.

**Advantages of WARs:**

* Versions of deployed apps can be simply identified.
* Web apps can be tested and deployed (even in multiple environments) quickly and efficiently.
* .war files are supported by all Java EE containers.
* [Model-View-Controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) software design can be easily adhered to.

**A Disadvantage of WARs:**

* Source code modifications require WARa to be repackaged and redeployed.
* .war structure/infrastructure may be overextensive, depending on app requirements.
