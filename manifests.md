# Intro to Manifest Files
  
**Overview:** The various features of [.jar files](/README.md), such as versioning, sealing, and digital signing, are made possible through the use of manifest files.
Manifests contain metadata about the files included/packaged within .jar files, and although they are generated by default they can also be modified. There can be only one
manifest file for a package at a time.

By default, the path to a .jar file's manifest is:

`META-INF/MANIFEST.MF`

And also by default, the data contained within this file is:

`Manifest-Version: 1.0`  
`Created-By: 1.7.0_06 (Oracle Corporation)`

The above data are stored as header-value pairs, which use colons as delimiters (separators).
